# Humdrum figured bass filter demo

Based on the [`hint -l`](https://www.humdrum.org/Humdrum/commands/mint.html)
command it should be possible to greate a filter for Humdrum that adds spines
for automatic detection of the figured bass numbers. For each voice separately
as *Intervallsatz*, or as real basso continuo numbers.
